Week 1 Assignments (12 week)
#############################

To get started, we will focus on looking at what we will be studying the
semester, and taking a look at a simple problem you might need to tackle
without knowing how to use a computer to do the job.

Learning how to program is not learning something magical. All a machine can to
is follow instructions a human provides, but a computer does that incredibly
fast. That is where their power comes from. It you tell it to do something
wrong, it will give you gibberish as answers, really fast. That is no good.

The power of the computer is tied directly to the power of your mind to come up
with a set of instructions that will work. THAT is what we want to learn here.

Oh yeah! And have a bit of fun along the way.
