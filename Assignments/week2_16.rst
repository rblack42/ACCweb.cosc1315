This week we start off by examining the hardware of a computer. That basic
design of computers dates back to WWII, and you will get a look at the basic
parts we use even today.

We will also look at the world of programming languages. You will explore only
one (well, maybe two if we could Scratch_) out of dozens out there.

Finally, we start building up a toolkit we will use to solve problems, then ask
the computer to do the work.

Homework
********

We need to start looking at how computers represent data, and what
kinds of data we can use in a real program. This homework will start you
examining that area.

Labs
****

This week, you get to fire up Scratch_ and start working with it. We will not
use all of this tool, a lot of it is for kids to play with. We will focus only
on those constructs we will see again in the real programming we do later in
the course.
