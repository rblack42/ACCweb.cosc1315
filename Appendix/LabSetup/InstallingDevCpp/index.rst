Installing Dev-C++
##################

We will use C++ as our programming language in this course. There are many ways
we could create and process programs, but for beginners, a simple way is to use
an ``Integrated Development Environment`` which provides a single program where
you can create code, get it ready to run, run it, and (oh well) debug it if it
does not work!

..  note::

    If you want to use a Mac, or Linux based system, you can use
    `Code::Blocks <http://www.codeblocks.org/>`_ instead. Instructions for
    installing that package are here:

        * :ref:`installing-codeblocks`


********************************
Downloading the DevCpp installer
********************************

We will use Dev-C++_,  which is a free tool
that runs on PC systems. 

Here is the link to the download site:

    * https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

**********************
Installing the package
**********************

..  warning::

    When you install this program, pay attention to any questions you might be
    asked. You need to install the program **for all users"** on your system. Failure
    to do this will result in the program being installed in a location that is
    difficult to handle. It should end up in your normal system application area. 

Follow the instructions on the screen when you run this program. Accept the
defaults for any questions asked. 

******************
Configuring DevCpp
******************

Once the program has been installed, start it up normally. When the window
displays, do these steps:

..  note::

    It appears that most of these settings are already set in the
    current release. Just check things.


* Navigate to :menuselection:`Tools --> Editor Options`
    * Check the :menuselection:`Highlight matching braces/parentheses`

* Click on :menuselection:`Fonts` menu tab
    * Check the :menuselection:`Line Numbers` box.
    * Click on :menuselection:`OK` to complete this part.

* Click on :menuselection:`Compiler Options --> Settings`
    * Click on the :menuselection:`Linker` option
    * Set :menuselection:`Generate debugging information` to Yes
    * Click on :menuselection:`OK` to complete this part.

..  note::

    I highly recommend that you use a laptop for programming courses, or any
    course that uses a computer for that matter. Having your working
    environment with you wherever you go can greatly improve your chances for
    success in your education and in your work!
